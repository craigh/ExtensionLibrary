Zikula ExtensionsLibrary
========================

ExtensionsLibrary is an automated browesable/searchable extensions listing module for the Zikula Application Framework

This version **requires** Zikula Core 1.3.7+

This module is not doing much yet. It has the backend automation in place but no user or admin interface at all.
