Zikula Extension Composer Specification
=======================================
(With sincere thanks and apologies to the jQuery crew, from whom this concept was basically reverse-engineered)

This document is all you need to know about what's required in your `composer.json` file(s).

[View the sample][sample-composer] `composer.json` file

The `composer.json` file is required by the [core specification](https://github.com/zikula/core/blob/1.3/UPGRADE-1.3.7.md#module-composerjson).
The `composer.json` file typically lives at the 'namespace' level of the extension. The files must be actual JSON, not
just a JavaScript object literal.


Fields
======

**ALL fields are required for core 1.4-only extensions. Extensions that are NOT Core 1.4-type (namespaced) MUST omit `autoload` and `extra`.**

 - [name](#name)
 - [description](#description) *
 - [type](#type) *
 - [license](#license) *
 - [authors](#authors) *
 - [require](#require)
 - [autoload](#autoload) **
 - [extra](#extra) **

Additional optional fields are allowed but not validated. Please see the entire spec at [the composer website](https://getcomposer.org/doc/04-schema.md#properties).
